After that, you will be asked if you want to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols in your password. If you select ok on the prompts, they will be used in your password. 

After you go through the prompts and select the criteria, you will be presented with a password in the box which you can copy. Please see the screenshot for a password with 128 characters that only used numbers. ![<image src = ".Assets/Images/ >](Assets/Images/password-creator.png)
